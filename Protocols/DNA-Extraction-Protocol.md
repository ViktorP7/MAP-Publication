## Part One: Bead Beater Cell Lysis & Ethanol Precipitation
1. Prepare 2mL screw cap tubes (Sarstedt, Germany) by adding approx. 200µl of 0.1mm silica beads (Biospec Products Inc) to each tube
2. Add 600µl of sterile 1M Tris-EDTA buffer (TE; Fisher Scientific, UK) to each tube 
3. Add 100µl of liquid culture containing as much MAP pellet as possible to the tubes 
4. Place tubes in a bead beater (MagNA Lyser, Roche) for three 40s runs at 6m/s 
5. Centrifuge tubes at 13,000rpm for 10 minutes
6. While centrifuging, label a set of 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes and add 45µl 3M sodium acetate (Sigma, Ireland) solution to each
7. Carefully take off 450µl of the supernatant without disturbing the beads below and add to newly labelled tubes 
8. Add 1ml of pre-chilled ice-cold 96% ethanol to each tube 
9. Vortex vigorously for 10s and place in -20C freezer for an hour 
10. Remove from the freezer and centrifuge at 13,000rpm for 15 minutes
11. Discard the solution carefully from each tube without disturbing the DNA pellet
12. Wash the DNA pellets for 1 minute with 70% ethanol 
13. Remove the ethanol and allow pellets to air-dry for 15 minutes
14. Resuspend each pellet in 50µl TE and place on a heating block set to 55C and a shaking speed of 1300rpm for 10 minutes to aid in resuspension

Note, after completing Step 14, the crude DNA extract can be stored overnight at 4C pending purification. For best results, it is advisable to proceed with purification immediately.

## Part Two: Magnetic Bead-Based DNA Purification
15. Add 81µl of Ampure XP magnetic purification beads (Beckman Coulter, UK) to each tube 
16. Vortex vigorously for 30s and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature 
17. Place tubes on a magnetic stand (Invitrogen) for 3 minutes and discard supernatant 
18. With the tubes still on the magnetic stand, wash with 200µl 80% ethanol for 1 minute
19. Wash again with 80% ethanol
20. Discard ethanol and leave on the magnetic stand to air-dry for 15 minutes
21. Resuspend the beads in each tube in 30µl of TE by pipetting up and down repeatedly
22. Place the tubes back on the magnet for 3 minutes
23. Take out 28µl of TE containing DNA from the tubes and place into newly labelled 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes
24. Store extracted DNA at 4C or -20C for short and long term storage respectively

Note, if extracted DNA quality is poorer than necessary, Part Two can be repeated on the extracts using a volume of 45µl of the Ampure XP beads. DNA concentration may be lessened during the re-purification.
