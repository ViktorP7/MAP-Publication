# MAP-Publication
This repository contains all necessary files used in or relevant to the MAP publication

## Processing Pipeline
The processing pipeline folder contains all scripts necessary to process .fastq.gz WGS files. The scripts in this folder were originally created by **Dr Joseph Crispell**, and are featured here with permission

## Protocols
The protocols folder acts as an addendum or supplement to the main methods section in the paper

## R Scripts
The R scripts featured in this directory were used to plot the phylogenetic tree and carry out any other plotting, etc.

You **MUST** run `DoPhylogeneticTrees_18-02-20.R` **first**, as the objects generated in that script, as well as loaded packages, are required to run the other scripts correctly.
